# Two stages: build the bundle, then serve it. The final image contains no Node, no toolchain, no
# source and no secret — an SPA is static files, and everything else in the image is attack
# surface for something it does not need to do.
#
# THE IMAGE CARRIES NO ENVIRONMENT. It is built once, tagged once, and the same tag is promoted
# from staging to production; the hosts it talks to are resolved in the browser from the address
# the page was served on. There is deliberately no build arg for an API URL, and adding one would
# undo the property this app inherits from the web template.

# The named context is the unpublished @cloudsforge/ui workspace, mirroring the `link:` specifier
# in package.json. It disappears when the package is published.
#   docker build -t hub-web --build-context uipkg=../ui .
